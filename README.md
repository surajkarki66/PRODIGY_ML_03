# PRODIGY_ML_03
## Overview
Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog). All the steps that are required for the experiment such as data preparation, model building, training, evaluation and saving are provided in the IPython notebook: `PRODIGY_ML_03.ipynb`. The model inference was done on `app.py`

## How to do inference?
1. Clone this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/surajkarki66/PRODIGY_ML_03
   ```
2. Create a Python virtual environment and activate the environment based on your machine(Linux, MacOS, and Windows)
3. Download the trained model from [here](https://github.com/surajkarki66/PRODIGY_ML_03/releases/download/V0.0.1/catvsdog.pkl) and put it into the project root directory.
4. Install the requirements
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the following command
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
